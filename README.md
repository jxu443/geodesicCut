# Geodesic Cut

Geodesic denotes the shortest possible line between two points on a sphere or other curved surface. Given the mesh and a starting point, simulate the effect of a rotating disk cutting along the the geodesic path.

## Objectives

1. Given a starting point and a direction, calculate the geodesic path on the mesh. 
2. Dick cutting along the path from 1. 
3. Texture mapping of my face on the disk

## How to use
Open any file in main folder with Processing, click on Run.
In the application, users can press 'g' to load a differnt model and 'G' to display it. 
Hover the mouse over an arbitrary point on the model and press '.' to generate a geodesic path from it. 
Press 'k' to show/hide disk.
(Press space key to show/hide UI helper)
